# :card_file_box: Restic Installer

üìù [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) is an awesome :package: backup utility, this is an script that installs it quickly on different platforms. 

### What platforms

Tested on: MacOS, Raspbian 32 bits (not tested on 64 bits but should work), CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, [Turris Omnia](https://omnia.turris.cz/en/) (OpenWRT).

### Breakdown

1. Checks if restic exists, if it exists, asks the user to update it.
2. If restic is not installed, it goes to github, checks for the lastest release and tries to insrtall the corresponding version.
2.5 It triest to install it in ```/usr/bin``` but if it's not possible (MacOS :trollface:) tries to install it into ```/usr/local/bin```
3. If the instalations is successfully it will ~~beg~~ ask to add an entry to ```/etc/crontab``` to update restic every night.
